    "\n",
    "* Number of samples (~20) per measurement: The std deviation was tiny w.r.t the mean.\n",
    "* Number of points (~60): Figure 2 shows that I measured too much of the peak's head and tail. We can reach the same spot size by cutting off the first and last 15 point\n",
    "* Interval (100um): This is where a delicate balance must be struck. From Figure 3, taking intervals of 200um (after cutting off the head and tail) reduces the accuracy of the fitting. The percentage difference between this new spot size and the more accurate one is 4.5%."
